auto_check
====================

This program works on all [http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/classes/11-642/HW/HW*/Testing.html](http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/classes/11-642/HW/HW1/Testing.html) pages.

First you need to load it as an unpacked extension in Google Chrome. Then on the test service pages, clicking on the *YueSeHan-PangMaiLang* icon will trigger one of the two events below:

* If only 1 checkbox is checked, the next 9 checkboxes will also be checked.
* If any other numbers of checkboxes are checked, all checks will be cleared.
